# System-Builder Overview

System-builder is a framework for creating and refining product documentation through AI-assisted workflows. It guides a product from initial concept through to implementation-ready specifications.

## Start Here (New Developers)

If you're new to system-builder, read these docs in order:

1. **This file** (`overview.md`) - Understand stages, workflows, and structure
2. **`workflow-create.md`** - How documents are created (the primary workflow)
3. **`workflow-review.md`** - How documents are refined (iterative improvement)
4. **A stage doc** (e.g., `01-blueprint.md`) - See how a specific stage works

## Getting Started

### 1. Initialise the project

```bash
../init-project.sh
```

This creates the required `system/` directories, deferred items files, pending issues files, and shared files. Safe to run multiple times. The script lives at the system-generator root (one level above `builder/`).

### 2. Run a workflow

Each stage has an orchestrator that coordinates the workflow. To create a document:

```
Read the [Stage] creation orchestrator at:
agents/[stage]/create/orchestrator.md

Then create a [Document] from:
- Concept: [path to your concept document]

Start the creation workflow.
```

Example (creating a Blueprint):
```
Read the Blueprint creation orchestrator at:
agents/01-blueprint/create/orchestrator.md

Then create a Blueprint from:
- Concept: my-project/concept.md

Start the creation workflow.
```

The orchestrator will guide you through each step, pausing for human input where needed.

## Stage Progression

Documentation progresses through twelve stages, each building on the previous:

```

```

| Stage | Purpose | Level of Detail |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| **Blueprint** | Vision, problem, users, business model, MVP definition | Strategic. No implementation. |
| **PRD** | What a specific phase delivers, scope boundaries | Functional. What, not how. |
| **Foundations** | Shared conventions, technology choices, patterns | Technical but stable. |
| **Architecture Overview** | System decomposition, component boundaries, data flows | Structural. |
| **Component Specs** | How to build each component | Implementation-ready. |
| **Tasks** | Discrete implementable work units | Actionable. |
| **Conventions** | Build standards derived from design docs (human approval) | Concrete. File paths, commands, patterns. |
| **Build** | Working code from task files, spec-fidelity checked | Executable. Modules, tests, IaC. |
| **Verification** | Lint, type check, unit test execution on built code | Execution. Real tool output. |
| **Provisioning** | Provisioning runbook from infrastructure tasks + built IaC | Operational. Real infrastructure commands. |
| **Packaging** | Standalone deliverable with developer-facing documentation | Handoff. Self-sustaining project. |
| **Operations Readiness** | Maintenance and operations artefact extraction | Operational. SLOs, runbooks, traceability. |

Stages 01–05 have guides (in `guides/`) that define what belongs at each level of abstraction.

## Workflows

Each stage supports two workflows:

### Create Workflow

Creates a draft document from inputs (concept, upstream documents). The human augments the draft, then runs Review to refine it.

```
Concept/Upstream ──▶ Generator ──▶ Human augments ──▶ Review Workflow
```

- **Generator** produces an initial draft with gaps marked
- **Human** reviews and fills in answers to open questions
- **Review Workflow** refines the document through expert review cycles

**Blueprint exception:** Blueprint has a custom create workflow with an Explore phase (strategic dimension exploration, enrichment review with three-tier depth filtering), iterative rounds, and a separate Decision Orchestrator. See `01-blueprint.md` for details.

**PRD exception:** PRD has a custom create workflow with an Explore phase (capability area decomposition, parallel explorers, enrichment review), iterative rounds, and inline decision resolution (no separate Decision Orchestrator). See `02-prd.md` for details.

**Foundations exception:** Foundations has a custom create workflow with an Assess step (lightweight technology assessment against PRD constraints, human directional preferences) before generation. The assessment informs the Generator's proposals, reducing gaps. See `03-foundations.md` for details.

**Architecture exception:** Architecture has a custom create workflow with a full Explore phase (architectural concern identification, parallel concern explorers, enrichment review), iterative rounds (round 1 from PRD + Foundations, round 2+ from previous draft), and gap resolution. See `04-architecture.md` for details.

### Review Workflow

Refines an existing document through iterative review cycles.

```
Document ──▶ Experts ──▶ Consolidator ──▶ Scope Filter ──▶ Human marks ──▶ Inline Discussion ──▶ Author ──▶ Alignment Verifier ──▶ Change Verifier ──┐
    ▲                                                                                                                                                    │
    └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Experts** identify issues (problems with existing content)
- **Human** responds naturally to each issue (no special keywords needed)
- **Inline Discussion** proposes and refines solutions within the issues-discussion file
- **Alignment Verifier** verifies document still aligns with sources after changes
- **Change Verifier** confirms approved solutions were applied correctly

Review cycles repeat until the document is satisfactory.

## Key Concepts

### Agents

Agents are AI prompts with specific roles. Each agent:
- Has a single responsibility (generate, review, merge, etc.)
- Reads from files, writes to files (file-first operation)
- Does not receive content passed inline—only file paths

Agents are either **universal** (apply to all stages) or **stage-specific** (tailored to a particular stage).

**Universal agents in standard workflows:**
- **Scope Filter** - Filters content to the appropriate abstraction level
- **Issue Analyst** - Analyses issues with options and recommendations before human review
- **Discussion Facilitator** - Facilitates iterative discussions to resolve issues (batched, with context)
- **Alignment Verifier** - Verifies document aligns with its source documents
- **Human Guidelines** - Guidance for human reviewers (reference, not an agent)

**Universal agents triggered manually (optional):**
- **Skeptic** - Cross-cutting expert that challenges assumptions and identifies weaknesses
- **Technical Writer** - Improves document clarity and consistency

See `workflow-create.md` and `workflow-review.md` for details on all agent types.

### Orchestrators

Orchestrators coordinate multi-step workflows. They:
- Manage workflow state (current step, status)
- Invoke agents in sequence
- Handle human interaction points
- Track progress in a state file

Each stage has a Create orchestrator and a Review orchestrator.

### Deferred Items

Content sometimes belongs at a different abstraction level than where it was raised. Deferred items files capture this content for the appropriate stage.

- Blueprint deferred items → holds PRD-level content found during Blueprint work
- PRD deferred items → holds Foundations-level content
- And so on

The Scope Filter agent filters content to deferred items files. This keeps each stage focused on its appropriate level of detail.

### Pending Issues

When working on a downstream document, you may discover that an upstream document has a problem (contradiction, missing requirement, etc.). Pending issues capture these for the upstream stage to address.

- PRD pending issues → problems in the PRD found during Foundations/Architecture work
- Blueprint pending issues → problems in the Blueprint found during PRD work
- And so on

**Deferred items flow downstream** (content that's too detailed for current stage). **Pending issues flow upstream** (problems in source documents discovered during downstream work).

The Alignment Verifier identifies pending issues. See `workflow-create.md` and `workflow-review.md` for details.

### Human Review

Workflows pause for human input at defined points:
- **Create workflow**: After issues are consolidated and filtered
- **Review workflow**: After issues are consolidated, and again after solutions are proposed

Humans provide decisions, answer questions, and approve changes. Guidance is in `docs/human-review-guide.md`.

Scripts `init-project.sh` and `build-prompts.sh` live at the system-generator root (one level above `builder/`).

## Round Numbering

Workflows use round numbers to track iterations:
- `round-0`: Create workflow (initial document creation) — for stages using the generic flow
- `round-1`, `round-2`, ...: Review workflow cycles (or create rounds for stages with exploration loops)

**Blueprint exception:** Blueprint's create workflow supports multiple rounds (`round-1`, `round-2`, ...) before promotion. Round 1 explores from `concept.md`, round 2+ explores from the previous round's draft. Review rounds continue from where create left off.

**PRD exception:** PRD's create workflow supports multiple rounds (`round-1`, `round-2`, ...) before promotion. Round 1 explores from `blueprint.md`, round 2+ explores from the previous round's draft. Review rounds continue from where create left off.

**Foundations exception:** Foundations uses `round-0` for creation (single round with assessment step, no multi-round exploration loop). Review rounds start from `round-1`.

**Architecture exception:** Architecture's create workflow supports multiple rounds (`round-1`, `round-2`, ...) before promotion. Round 1 explores from PRD + Foundations, round 2+ explores from the previous round's draft. Review rounds continue from where create left off.

All rounds for a stage share a `versions/` folder with a unified state file.
